    <div>About Me:</div>
    <p> Hi! My name is Sumaya. I am currently a senior at Shakopee High School
    and am 16 years old. I am also the middle child of my family, and as a middle child
    of six siblings I learned how to be independent at a young age. Which brings me to
    Girls Who Code. I applied for this program during my junior year of high school after
    hearing about it through a tutoring program that I attend, and I was able to get to
    know they basics of computer science and was also exposed to many of the different
    career choices that people take when entering into the tech work experience. </p>
